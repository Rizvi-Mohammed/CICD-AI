# AI-Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline (Under Construction)
![alt text](https://github.com/Rizvi-Mohammed/CICD-AI/blob/main/codetoflow.png?raw=true)

A lightweight CI/CD pipeline that uses AWS Bedrock and Claude to enhance each stage with AI-powered insights and decision-making capabilities.

## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates how AI can improve traditional CI/CD pipelines by adding context-aware intelligence at critical decision points. The pipeline leverages large language models (via AWS Bedrock) to:

- Provide smarter code quality suggestions beyond what static analyzers can detect
- Assess security vulnerabilities with application context
- Recommend targeted test improvements based on code changes
- Analyze infrastructure-as-code for security and optimization opportunities
- Make risk-based deployment decisions with multiple factors considered

## 📋 Features

- **AI-Enhanced Code Analysis**: Gets intelligent code improvement suggestions beyond linting
- **Smart Security Scanning**: Contextually assesses and prioritizes security issues
- **Test Coverage Recommendations**: Suggests what tests should be added based on changes
- **Infrastructure Validation**: Analyzes IaC for issues, compliance, and optimizations
- **Risk-Based Deployment**: Automatically prevents high-risk deployments
- **Build Summary & Insights**: Provides executive summary with key learnings

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- AWS account with Bedrock access
- Git
- Dependencies listed in requirements.txt (coming soon)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-cicd-pipeline.git
cd ai-cicd-pipeline

# Install dependencies (once requirements.txt is added)
# pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up AWS credentials
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
export AWS_REGION=us-west-2
```

### Usage

Currently, this is a proof-of-concept with a single main script. To use it:

```python
from main import AICICDPipeline

# Initialize the pipeline
pipeline = AICICDPipeline(
    repo_url="https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git",
    branch="main"
)

# Run the pipeline
results = pipeline.run_pipeline()

# Check results
print(f"Pipeline success: {results['success']}")
print(f"AI Summary: {results.get('ai_summary', {}).get('conclusion', 'No summary available')}")
```

## 🚧 Current Status

This is a work-in-progress demonstration of the concept. Currently, the project contains:

- `main.py`: Core pipeline implementation with AI integration points

Planned additions:
- Missing module implementations for each component
- AWS Bedrock integration code
- Configuration options
- CLI interface
- Example prompts and response parsers
- Docker support
- Unit tests

## 📝 How It Works

The pipeline follows these stages:

1. **Code Analysis**:
   - Runs static analysis tools
   - Sends issues to LLM for intelligent suggestions

2. **Security Scanning**:
   - Identifies vulnerabilities using security scanners
   - LLM assesses actual risk level with context

3. **Testing**:
   - Runs test suite
   - LLM suggests specific tests to add based on code changes

4. **Infrastructure Validation**:
   - Validates infrastructure code syntactically
   - LLM reviews for best practices and optimizations

5. **Deployment Decision**:
   - Combines results from all stages
   - LLM calculates overall risk level on scale of 0-5
   - Automatically halts deployment if risk level > 3

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Quality gates**: Prevent low-quality or risky code from being deployed
- **Developer feedback**: Provide actionable suggestions for improvement
- **Security enhancement**: Get contextual security risk assessment
- **Knowledge sharing**: Capture expert knowledge in AI suggestions
- **Compliance automation**: Ensure infrastructure meets standards

## 📊 Example Outputs

The pipeline produces a comprehensive results object with information from each stage:

```json
{
  "build_id": "build-20250402-123456",
  "repository": "https://github.com/example/repo.git",
  "branch": "main",
  "started_at": "2025-04-02T12:34:56.789Z",
  "completed_at": "2025-04-02T12:36:23.456Z",
  "success": true,
  "stages": {
    "code_analysis": {
      "issues_found": 12,
      "ai_suggestions": { ... }
    },
    "security_scan": {
      "vulnerabilities": 3,
      "ai_risk_assessment": {
        "risk_level": 2,
        "critical_issues": 0,
        "high_issues": 1,
        "medium_issues": 2,
        "analysis": "..."
      }
    },
    ...
  },
  "ai_summary": {
    "conclusion": "Build successful with minor issues. The security vulnerability in the API authentication module should be addressed in the next sprint."
  }
}
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Web dashboard for visualizing results
- Integration with popular CI/CD platforms (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.)
- Historical trend analysis
- AI-driven rollback decisions
- Customizable risk thresholds and policies
- Fine-tuning based on organization-specific patterns
